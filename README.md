Using Machine learning algorithm on the famous Titanic Disaster Dataset for Predicting the survival of the passenger

The most famous competition over the Kaggle. In this Repository, I intend to explain to every beginner how to begin with Kaggle very first time. So this repository is for those who just begin their Machine Learning Journey. In this notebook i try to take down every single topic with a very naive approach so every beginner can grasp it very easily.

Dependencies:

Python3
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Supervised Learning
Machine Learning Algorithm
Classification Algorithms

Data Handling
Importing Data with Pandas
Cleaning Data
Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib
Data Analysis:

Supervised Machine learning Techniques: + Logit Regression Model + Plotting results + Support Vector Machine (SVM) using 3 kernels + Basic Random Forest + Plotting results.
